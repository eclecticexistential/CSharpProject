# Grocery - Code Louisville C# Project

App makes it possible for users to imitate shopping online for their groceries. Consumables are divided into meats, plants, and baking goods on their respective pages. On the recipes page, however, users can add recipe items to shopping cart with one click.

Once a user selects their chosen items the shopping cart button appears. For mobile users, this button appears up in the hamburger menu.

After navigating to the shopping cart page, users can add or reduce the number of each item in the cart or delete items as they see fit.

Upon deciding to purchase items, users can click 'checkout' and a thank you for shopping with us message appears, simulating the checkout process.

Newest Update: Users can now share meal ideas with others by adding customized recipes to the page. Each new recipe features ingredients, recipe description, estimated price, and ability to add directly to shopping cart.
